> ### Elite strap powerbank 🚧  
> The Oculus Quest 2 elite strap has a version with a ~10,000 mAh battery pack. The goal here is to tear the whole thing apart, re-wire the battery itself, adding several USB-A connectors, and 3D-printing a new casing, with battery level indicators.  
>   
> I got this idea after Facebook sent me a free replacement elite strap, so now I have a 10,000 mAh battery just lying around.

> ### Audio/Video mixer ❌  
> Sometimes you just want to replace or add some music to a video clip.  
> This would be a simple website where you can upload or paste a link to 2 video clips. Then you have the ability to replace or add the audio from one clip, to the other with the simple press of a button.

> ### Interactive Fate/ timeline 🚧 ([repo](https://github.com/TheColorman/Fate-Timeline))
> It could be fun to create a complete timeline of the Fate franchise with interactive elements such as hiding of speicifc series.  
> https://reactflow.dev/ looks like it could work.

> ### Docs Copilot ❌  
> GitHub copilot is amazing, and I've used it so much that I got used to autocompletion on everything I typed. Problem is, when writing normally in places like Google Docs, there's no autocomplete.  
> Integration of GPT-3 into writing like GitHub Copilot in the form a chrome extension.
