> ### Elite strap powerbank 🚧  
> The Oculus Quest 2 elite strap has a version with a ~10,000 mAh battery pack. The goal here is to tear the whole thing apart, re-wire the battery itself, adding several USB-A connectors, and 3D-printing a new casing, with battery level indicators.  
>   
> I got this idea after Facebook sent me a free replacement elite strap, so now I have a 10,000 mAh battery just lying around.

> ### Audio/Video mixer ❌  
> Sometimes you just want to replace or add some music to a video clip.  
> This would be a simple website where you can upload or paste a link to 2 video clips. Then you have the ability to replace or add the audio from one clip, to the other with the simple press of a button.
