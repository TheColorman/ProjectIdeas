> ### Elite strap powerbank ⏸ (3D-printer required)  
> The Oculus Quest 2 elite strap has a version with a ~10,000 mAh battery pack. The goal here is to tear the whole thing apart, re-wire the battery itself, adding several USB-A connectors, and 3D-printing a new casing, with battery level indicators.  
>   
> I got this idea after Facebook sent me a free replacement elite strap, so now I have a 10,000 mAh battery just lying around.

> ### Audio/Video mixer 🚧 ([repo](https://github.com/TheColorman/audio-replacer)) (School exam project)  
> Sometimes you just want to replace or add some music to a video clip.  
> This would be a simple website where you can upload or paste a link to 2 video clips. Then you have the ability to replace or add the audio from one clip, to the other with the simple press of a button.

> ### Interactive Fate/ timeline 🚧 ([repo](https://github.com/TheColorman/Fate-Timeline))
> It could be fun to create a complete timeline of the Fate franchise with interactive elements such as hiding of speicifc series.  
> https://reactflow.dev/ looks like it could work.  
  
  <br/>
  
> ### Docs Copilot ❌  
> GitHub copilot is amazing, and I've used it so much that I got used to autocompletion on everything I typed. Problem is, when writing normally in places like Google Docs, there's no autocomplete.  
> Integration of GPT-3 into writing like GitHub Copilot in the form a chrome extension.

> ### Spotify advanced playlist sort ❌  
> The perfect party requires the perfect playlist, and what better way to sort a playlist than creating a curve based on some points, and then ordering the playlist baded on factors such as BPM? With this it's possible to control spikes in playlist energy.    
> Use the Spotify API to get song information, then sort song based on user-generated curve.

> ### AniList.co advanced sort ❌  
> Third party website with advanced sorting of you animelist from AniList.co, since you can't sort lists by things like global score.  
> They have a developer API so that's cool.
